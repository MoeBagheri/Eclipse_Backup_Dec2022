He is going to change the file and use different
file with the same format

** have to find the file: 
what is the file name of the file you want to use user
has to enter the file name

for now take the input file we already have 
has to read it and perform a sort (write Charts)
sorting by key
how long it it going to take for to do 6 sorts: selection sort,
bubble sort, short sort, instruction sort, merge sort,
quick sort (last 2 should be faster)
make sure you get the 6 sorts working even by changing the file
take the main from hw6

** after reading the file take it and create map entries then sort it
u do not need to write merge sort and short sorts code just
fix it from sorts.java use ME to sort
each entry goes to map entry once u read the file
each file u get map entry value array turns into map entry

** comparison of map entry of that map tree
compare the keys only

timing for all this is required 

** also print:
-what do you want to print? 
user answers:

print the sorted key
top five
top end elementals 
.
.
.we have to guess what else he might want





find middle one for QS
assume that file is in your project direction
slection sort
time 
number of swaps

merge sort 
time and number of swaps
