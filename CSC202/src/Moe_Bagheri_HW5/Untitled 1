HW # 5 is based on HW  # 4. You need to modify the following code from the book

Part 1: modify methods related to add; discussed in detail (use recFind(.))

Part 2: level-order traversal for the BST

Part 1) rewrite recAdd --> so that it uses the code similar to containsXXX --> find the parent node to add a new node for building a BST

== from HW # 4 ==

The BT tree has been built.

Traverse? (1: preorder, 2: inorder, 3: postorder)

> 3

postorder: 7, 8,3,4,1,9,5,6,2,0

Given the traversal above, a BST has been built using new addNode(.) methods.

postorder of the BST: 0, 2, 1, 6,5,4,3, 9,8,7

levelorder of the BST: 7,3,8, 1,4,9, 0,2,5, 6
