Build a binary tree (BT, not a BST) based on the specification below.
 Traverse the BT and output the sequence. 
 Use the sequence to build a binary search tree (BST).
 Use all relevant BST code from the book.
  Make BT extend BST.

5, 9

3, 7, 8

2, 5, 6

1, 3, 4

0, 1, 2

== sample output session

The BT tree has been built.

Traverse? (1: preorder, 2: inorder, 3: postorder)

> 3

postorder: 7, 8,3,4,1,9,5,6,2,0

Given the traversal above, a BST has been built.

postorder: 0, 2, 1, 6,5,4,3, 9,8,7

///////

we can use array list to store the tree we have 
but dont make the tree using the array list only

line 7 to 15 are the input files

we have to use the BSTNode.java

PS:
we have the list symbols then we have another row  for the tree list
my 5 gives me 9
in the first then when we hit 256 the code has to make a new tree in 2 go back and
bring up the "5 and 9" and then add the 6 to the tree


take line -- and make a binary search tree
